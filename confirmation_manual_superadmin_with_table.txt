I have completely rewritten `superadmin_custom_creation_instructions.txt` with detailed PostgreSQL commands to manually create the `users` table, define the `role_enum`, and insert your custom superadmin user with a hashed password.

Please follow the instructions in `superadmin_custom_creation_instructions.txt` carefully and let me know the outcome. This should allow you to log in successfully.
