I have provided comprehensive instructions on how to create a custom superadmin user by modifying the `superadmin.seeder.ts` file, running the seed command, and including the necessary `emailVerified: true` setting for immediate login. This should resolve your inability to log in after creating a superadmin.

Please follow the steps outlined in `superadmin_custom_creation_instructions.txt` and let me know the outcome.
