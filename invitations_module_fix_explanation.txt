I have applied the `forwardRef` to `UsersModule` in `InvitationsModule`'s imports.

This should finally resolve the circular dependency issue that was causing the "Nest cannot create the InvitationsModule instance" error when running the seed command. The chain of circular dependencies (`AuthModule <-> InvitationsModule <-> UsersModule`) should now be correctly handled by `forwardRef` at both ends.

Please try running `npm run seed` again. If it succeeds, you can then follow the instructions in `superadmin_creation_instructions.txt` to try logging in.
